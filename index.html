Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, <i>b</i>y Ji<b>m</b>my W<b>a</b>les and Larry Sanger.[15] Sanger coined i<b>t</b>s name,[16][17] as a blend of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for "q<i>u</i>ick")[18] and "encyclopedia". Ini<b>t</b>ially an English-language encyclopedia, ve<i>r</i>sions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickl<i>y</i> developed. With 6.1 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 52 million articles[19] attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors per month.[20][21]
In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,[22] although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.[23][24] The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[25]
